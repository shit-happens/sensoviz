>Worked on developing advanced image processing and computer vision 
C++ libraries to be deployed in automated industrial inspection systems.

>Worked extensively on real-time steel surface inspection systems, more
specifically fasteners which apart from anomaly detection also involves
measuring the parameters of a screw in real-time and filtering out the 
ones outside the bounds of user-specified tolerance.
